### Hello there 👋 My name is Shikhar Mohan (he/him)

🔋 I'm a final year Undergrad from the department of E & ECE, IIT Kharagpur.

🌻 I'm very interested in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, and pursuing research in these very topics!

🧠 I've worked on Self-Supervised Learning under MLO Laboratory, EPFL (Switzerland) and Biomedical Image Analysis under Dept. of E & ECE, IIT Kharagpur.

💻 Email me on shikhar_mn@iitkgp.ac.in anytime! I will be happy to respond 😁

💁 When I'm not working on my research, I'm usually either gaming or practising my speeches for parliamentary debating
