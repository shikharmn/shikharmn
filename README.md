### Hello there 👋 My name is Shikhar Mohan (he/him)

🔋 I'm an Applied Scientist at Microsoft India, in the INTL Bing Ads Understanding Team. Here, I work on problems related to recommendation systems.

🧠 In the past, I've spent two amazing years as a Research Fellow in Manik Varma's Extreme Classification Team, where I worked on multimodality in Recommendation Systems.

🧠 Prior to that, I've worked on Self-Supervised Learning under MLO Laboratory, EPFL (Switzerland) and Biomedical Image Analysis under Dept. of E & ECE, IIT Kharagpur.

💻 Email me on mohan.shikhar11@gmail.com anytime! I will be happy to respond 😁

💁 When I'm not working on my research, I'm usually either gaming or playing table tennis when a few GPUs do all the hard work.
