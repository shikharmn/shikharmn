### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Shikhar Mohan (he/him)

- I'm a pre-final year Undergrad from the department of E & ECE, IIT Kharagpur.
- I'm very interested in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, and pursuing research in these very topics!
- I'm currently learning Deep Unsupervised Learning from CS294-158-SP20, and reading up on relevant research elsewhere in computer vision
- My ongoing research work includes Target Oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification and Biomedical Image Understanding, both under professors in IIT Kharagpur.
- Email me on shikhar_mn@iitkgp.ac.in anytime! I will be happy to respond
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not working on my research, I'm usually either gaming or practising university level parliamentary debating
